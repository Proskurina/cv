#####About me

I am a tax dispute resolution lawyer with 15 years of experience. For the past 13 years, I worked at PwC’s Moscow office where I started as a Junior Associate and then progressed to be a Partner.

I moved to London a year ago to pursue a new career in technology. Recently, I completed an intensive three-month bootcamp to learn test-driven development of applications and websites with no prior experience. I believe in TDD, clean code and SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

I am looking for a Junior Software Developer position in London where I can continue to learn and help solve problems using different technologies.

#####Skills

######Knowledge acquiring skills

I am a quick learner, I felt comfortable during a highly intensive coding bootcamp (Makers Academy).

Projects:

- In 10 days completed a team project called ‘Hot Hot Cold’ which is a location-based game using Firebase, Angular JS, Ionic. I used Xcode to test the game on iPhone. Also I deployed a test version to GooglePlay (https://github.com/Benaud12/checkpoint_game )

- In 2 days completed a team project called ‘Whistle stop’ which is a Chrome extension, that closes window tabs on whistle (https://github.com/Proskurina/whistle_stop )

- After a week of learning Rails I build simplified version of Instagram-like website using Rails, AS3, and deployed it to Heroku (https://github.com/Proskurina/instagram-challenge, https://floating-headland-7222.herokuapp.com )

- After a week of learning JS I built an app that counts and sums the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JS, https://github.com/Proskurina/bowling-challenge)

I actively participate in Agileventures LocalSupport project (http://www.agileventures.org/).

On my previous work I also dealt with knowledge acquiring on daily basis (for example, I had to analyse up to 200 court cases weekly). I was highly respected for my deep knowledge of Russian tax court practice and Russian tax law in general. 


######Teamwork

I am a team player. Ability to work in a team was a key in my previous career. I worked in a team of more than 700 professionals and managed to build good working relationship with everyone. 

######Responsibility and self-motivation

I am responsible and self-motivated.

I started to learn coding by myself, I successfully completed MIT and Udacity online courses on Computer science (programming using Python), passing all the test before/within deadlines. All projects within Makers Academy were also delivered within deadlines. Now I continue my self-development working as a volunteer on Agileventures projects for non-profit organisations.

As for my previous experience, my skills could be illustrated by the fact that I build tax dispute resolution group in PwC Russia from scratch. In couple of years my group’s revenue reached 1m USD, and then 2-2.5m USD (with 35-40% margin). I led over 200 tax disputes with success rate of 98%.

######Client work

I am good at client work. I can put myself in client shoes, understand client’s needs, manage their expectations, build relationship with them. I worked with many clients including multinational companies (i.e. Pepsi, Universal, LG, Samsung and many others).

######Verbal communication

I can explain difficult things using simple words. I explained difficult tax concepts to Russian judges. Many times I was a ‘translator’ between lawyers and economists, lawyers/economists and clients. And now I am ready to become a translator between tech and non-tech professionals.
